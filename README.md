## 📌 About

This portfolio was created as part of my MSc in Data Science coursework to demonstrate practical knowledge of core machine learning algorithms. Each project is organized into its own folder, featuring:

- End-to-end implementation using Jupyter Notebooks
- Dataset preprocessing & exploration
- Model building and evaluation
- Tuning and improvements
- Reflections and learnings

## 📂 Project Showcase

| 📁 Project | 🔍 Description |
|-----------|----------------|
| [Decision Tree](./Decision%20Tree) | Built a decision tree classifier with entropy/gini options and visualized the tree |
| [K-Means](./K%20means) | Clustered data using k-means with elbow method and silhouette score |
| [K-Nearest Neighbors](./KNN) | Implemented KNN classifier with optimal k selection |
| [Linear Regression](./Linear%20Regression) | Applied linear regression to predict continuous variables; included model evaluation |
| [Logistic Regression](./Logistic%20Regression) | Used logistic regression for binary classification; tuned regularization |
| [Naive Bayes](./Naive%20Bayes) | Text classification using Gaussian/Bernoulli Naive Bayes |
| [Random Forest](./Random%20Forest) | Ensemble learning via random forest classifier and feature importance |
| [Support Vector Machines](./Support%20Vector%20Machines) | Built and tuned SVM with different kernels (linear, rbf) |

> 📌 Each folder contains a Jupyter Notebook, plots, and model results.
