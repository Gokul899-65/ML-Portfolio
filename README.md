## 📌 About

This portfolio was created as part of my MSc in Data Science coursework. It contains structured Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate practical knowledge of machine learning and deep learning concepts. Projects span both traditional ML and neural networks using various algorithms and datasets.

Each folder includes:
- Notebook implementation
- Data preprocessing & visualizations
- Model training, evaluation, and improvement
- Experiment tracking and insights
